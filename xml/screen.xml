  <action title="Install screen" anchor="install">
    On gentoo installing screen is quite simple:
    <code>root# emerge screen</code>
  </action>
    
  <action title="Set some usefull preferences" anchor="screenrc">
    Create the file <lt>~/.screenrc</lt> with the following contents:
    <code>
# Use visual bell
vbell on

# Set a big scrolling buffer
defscrollback 5000

# Set the caption on the bottom line
caption always "%{= kw}%-w%{= BW}%n %t%{-}%+w %-= @%H - %LD %d %LM - %c"

# Support UTF-8
defutf8 on

# Don't show the slash screen
startup_message off
    </code>
  </action>
    
  <action title="Start your first screen session" anchor="start">
    Start screen itself (<i>this will be the master screen, or number
    <literal>0</literal></i>):
    <code>user# screen</code>
    Now open a program you want to be able to disconnect and connect to:
    <code>user# irssi</code>
  </action>

	<action title="Detach from the running screen session" anchor="detach">
		Don't worry, irssi won't actually quit, but type:
		<literal>ctrl+a ctrl+d</literal>
		<br/>
		At this point you will return to your shell prompt, but irssi
		is still running in the background, pretty neat!
    </action>
    
  <action title="Reconnect to the running screen session" anchor="reconnect">
    Here's how you reconnect to the master screen session:
    <code>user# screen -r -d</code>
  </action>
    
  <action title="Create another screen" anchor="create_another">
    This will be the first child screen, thus named <literal>1</literal>
    <br/>
    Type: <literal>ctrl+a c</literal> to create it.
    Now you should see a shell prompt again, try doing:
    <code>user# top</code>
    which will open up the performance monitor in this screen.
  </action>
    
  <action title="Toggle between the two screens" anchor="toggle">
    Since you now have two screens running, you have two ways to toggle
    back and forth:
    <list>
      <element>
        Use <literal>ctrl+a n</literal> to go next, and
        <literal>ctrl+a p</literal> to go previous.
      </element>
      <element>
        You can also specify the screen name by number like this:
        <literal>ctrl+a 1</literal> to toggle to "top" and
        <literal>ctrl+a 0</literal> to toggle to "irssi".
      </element>
    </list>
  </action>
    
  <action title="Assign a name to the currently active screen" anchor="name">
    Type: <literal>ctrl+a A</literal> which will give you a little
    prompt, it will probably have <literal>bash</literal> as the
    current name, hit the backspace key a few times, and then type
    in a name you will recognize.  Use the enter key to save this
    screen name.
  </action>
    
  <action title="Pull up a list of all running screens" anchor="list">
    If you get a bunch of screens running, you might need a list to
    find one faster (here your names are super helpfull). Do:
    <literal>ctrl+a "</literal> which will give you a list, you can
    either type in the number [0 - 9] or use the arrow keys to
    navigate, again just hit enter to choose it.
  </action>
    
  <action title="Scrolling up/down in a screen" anchor="scrolling">
    If you need to scroll up or down you need to enable <i>copy mode</i>.
    To do this do: <lt>ctrl+a ESC</lt> and then use the arrow keys and page
    up/page down keys to navigate.  When you're finished hit <lt>ESC</lt>
    to return to normal mode.
  </action>
    
  <action title="How do you close a screen?" anchor="close">
    Closing the program running in the screen should take care of
    it.  For example, if you do <literal>ctrl+a ctrl+n</literal>
    which will create a new screen and leave you at a shell prompt,
    hitting <literal>ctrl+d</literal> to exit the shell will also
    close the screen.  If you're ever not sure who many are running,
    just use <literal>ctrl+a "</literal> to view the ones running.
  </action>
    
  <action title="Quick toggle between two screens" anchor="quick_toggle">
    If you're using two screens and wanna quickly go back and forth
    between them, use: <literal>ctrl+a ctrl+a</literal>
  </action>
    
  <action title="Fixing a screen that seems locked" anchor="fix_lock">
    If you hit <lt>ctrl+s</lt> or <lt>ctrl+a s</lt> you can lock the
    screen...
    <br/><br/>
    The fix is to hit <literal>ctrl+a q</literal>
  </action>
    
  <action title="How to list running screens" anchor="ls">
    You can always list the screens that you have by doing:
    <code>screen -ls</code>
    Unfortunately this doesn't show screens of other users.  The only
    way I [currently] know how to do this is to look using
    <lt>ps</lt>:
    <code>ps -ef | grep SCREEN</code>
  </action>

  <action title="Shared screens" anchor="shared_screen">
    Temporarily make screen setuid (<i>remove this when your finished</i>):
    <code>
root# chmod u+s /usr/bin/screen
root# chmod go-w /var/run/screen
    </code>

    Start a screen session:
    <code>user# screen</code> Then do (<i>where <literal>guest</literal>
    is the userid of the person who's going to connect to the shared
    session, and <literal>owner</literal> is the userid of the
    person creating the shared session, aka the person who owns the
    computer</i>):
    <code>
ctrl+a :multiuser on          <cmt>#Enable shared sessions</cmt>
ctrl+a :acladd guest          <cmt>#Give rights to guest</cmt>
ctrl+a :aclchg guest -x "?"   <cmt>#Revoke permission to execute commands</cmt>
    </code>

    Then the other user will ssh to the box, and execute:
    <code>user# screen -x owner/</code>
    to join my session
    <br/><br/>
    <tip>
      If you are unable to connect to the screen session try using the
      fully qualified name, like this:
      <lt>screen -x owner/9322.pts-2.monster</lt>
    </tip>
    <br/>
    When you're finished with the session, clean things up by exiting the
    screen session, and do: 
    <code>
root# chmod u-s /usr/bin/screen
root# chmod 775 /var/run/screen
    </code>
  </action>
    
  <action title="Screwed up screens" anchor="screwed_up_screens">
      So maybe I've had a problem where a screen session seemed to
      locup a time or two.  Here's some really good advice from
      <link uri="http://lizzie.spod.cx/screenirssi.shtml">
        lizzie.spod.cx:
      </link>
      <p>
        "<i>If you accidentally freeze screen (usually this happens if
        you hit <literal>ctrl+s</literal> or <literal>ctrl+a
        s</literal> you can fix it by hitting
        <literal>ctrl+q</literal> or <literal>ctrl+a q</literal>.
        Another way to potentially break screen is if you it the
        pause/break button while using putty or
        <literal>ctrl+z</literal>, then you simply need to type fg at
        the command line to bring your irssi session back. The
        <literal>fg</literal> trick also works should you manage to
        make anything else in screen dissappear with
        <literal>ctrl+z</literal> or pause/break.</i>"
      </p>

  <action title="Getting help on commands" anchor="help">
    You can get help by using: <literal>ctrl+a ?</literal>.  The
    Gentoo wiki also has some very good
    <link uri="http://gentoo-wiki.com/TIP_Using_screen">
      documentation
    </link> on using screen.
